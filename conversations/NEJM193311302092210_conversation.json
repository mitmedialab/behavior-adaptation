I did not think much about his heart at the time, and at that time antisyphilitic treatment was started cautiously. He was sent home.'"

I examined him, and in listening to the heart I was amazed to find perfectly clear cut signs of aortic insufficiency, if one can make a diagnosis on murmurs alone. I think there was no record of a diastolic murmur at the second entry. He had signs of heart failure which were very striking. He was orthopneic and cyanotic.
