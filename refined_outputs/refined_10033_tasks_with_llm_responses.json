        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'reconciling a complex symptom history with a final diagnosis', requires the AI to actively synthesize information from the patient's description of the pain and infer its relationship to the perforated duodenal ulcer, rather than simply stating the given information. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely fail to connect the specific timing of pain onset, its relief mechanisms, and the recurrence with solid food to the underlying pathophysiology of a perforated duodenal ulcer, missing the significance of this historical detail. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to over-interpretation of the symptom history, potentially suggesting other less likely diagnoses without sufficient evidence, thereby creating unnecessary confusion. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent retrieving relevant information about the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease, synthesizing this knowledge with the patient's reported pain characteristics, and explaining how these features support the diagnosis of a perforated duodenal ulcer. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic reasoning and understanding of disease mechanisms. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data to refine a differential diagnosis. Answer Rationale: Peptic ulcer disease, particularly those involving the duodenum, often presents with pain that begins after eating due to acid secretion or mechanical irritation of the ulcer. Antacids (milk) neutralize acid, leading to relief.

Other potential causes like metabolic disorders, psychiatric conditions, or chronic infections should also be considered.\n- **Proactive Approach:** This choice reflects a balanced and cautious approach, acknowledging the importance of thorough evaluation and ruling out multiple potential causes before proceeding to surgery, particularly given the significant weight loss."

History of Present Illness Summary: Recent weight loss (36 lbs in 3 months), continuous dull lower back pain. Key Physical Exam Findings (Initial): Tender point over sacroiliac articulation. Imaging Findings: X-ray: Appearance of proliferation and slight roughening of vertebrae margins suggesting arthritic process. No definite abnormality in sacroiliac region. Turn 19 (Dr. Richardson): Anatomical diagnosis: perforated duodenal ulcer... just past the pylorus, on the posterior lateral wall of the duodenum, there was a 12x12mm ulcer with a perforation in its base. Old adhesions around it.\n\n=== QUESTION ===\nThe patient presented with new-onset continuous dull lower back pain and a tender point over the sacroiliac articulation, concurrent with the recent, rapid weight loss and increasing abdominal symptoms. The initial X-ray suggested a possible arthritic process in the vertebrae but no definite sacroiliac abnormality. How should these seemingly musculoskeletal findings have been evaluated and integrated into the differential diagnosis alongside the dominant upper GI picture prior to the final diagnosis becoming clear?\n\n=== OPTIONS ===\nA: Without definitive radiographic evidence from the initial X-ray, more sensitive musculoskeletal imaging such as an MRI of the SI joints should have been pursued immediately to fully characterize the orthopedic findings before integrating them with the abdominal picture.\nB: Back pain in the setting of significant abdominal pathology, especially ulcer disease or malignancy, can be referred pain, particularly if the lesion is posterior (like the duodenal ulcer ultimately found). While musculoskeletal issues were considered and partially supported by X-ray, the timing of the back pain coinciding with the worsening upper GI symptoms and weight loss should have raised suspicion that the back pain was related to the primary abdominal process, rather than being an isolated orthopedic issue. Specifically, posterior penetration or involvement of retroperitoneal structures by a duodenal ulcer is a known cause of back pain.\nC: The specific finding of tenderness over the sacroiliac articulation provided clear physical evidence of a primary sacroiliac joint process, justifying a diagnostic pathway focused on local inflammatory or mechanical causes independently of the systemic GI symptoms.\nD: The preliminary X-ray evidence of possible vertebral arthritis was the most tangible finding and should have guided initial treatment towards a primary spinal pathology, potentially masking the significance of the coexisting upper GI issues.\nE: The combination of weight loss and back pain should have primarily raised suspicion for metastatic disease to the spine from an occult GI primary, making other potential causes like referred pain less likely and less urgent to investigate.\n\nChoose the single best option and provide a brief rationale for your choice.\n\n=== YOUR RESPONSE ===",

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'integrating seemingly disparate clinical findings to refine a differential diagnosis', requires the AI to actively synthesize information from different parts of the patient's presentation and infer potential connections between musculoskeletal symptoms and the GI symptoms, going beyond simply acknowledging the stated findings. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely fail to recognize the potential for referred pain or other systemic involvement, leading to a missed opportunity for a more comprehensive assessment. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might prematurely jump to conclusions about rare or unlikely diagnoses without sufficient justification from the available data, creating unnecessary alarm and diverting attention from more probable explanations. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent retrieving relevant knowledge about referred pain patterns and systemic effects of GI pathology, inferring how the GI symptoms could manifest as musculoskeletal pain, and synthesizing this information to suggest further investigations or alternative interpretations of the X-ray findings. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prevent premature diagnostic closure. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here, as the AI must retrieve information about referred pain and synthesize it with the patient's overall presentation to arrive at a more complete understanding of the case.

Clinically, this should raise high suspicion that either the X-ray was misinterpreted, the lesion was subtle/missed (like a posterior ulcer), or the obstruction was functional or related to a different process not visualized by initial methods. Post-operatively, this necessitates extremely close monitoring for persistent symptoms, signs of complications (like peritonitis, ongoing obstruction), and rapid consideration of further investigations or re-exploration if the patient's condition does not improve as expected or deteriorates.\nD: Assume the obstruction was purely functional and resolved spontaneously prior to or during surgery, requiring no altered post-operative monitoring for recurrent obstruction.\nE: Plan immediate post-operative imaging (e.g., repeat Barium study) within 24 hours to definitively rule out a missed lesion, regardless of the patient's clinical status.\n\nChoose the single best option and provide a brief rationale for your choice.\n\n=== YOUR RESPONSE ===",

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[highly_proactive]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'highly_proactive' with a proactive_score of 1.0 (within the 0.8-1.0 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'evaluating conflicting pre-operative and intraoperative findings to determine appropriate post-operative management', requires the AI to actively detect and resolve a critical conflict between diagnostic imaging and direct surgical observation. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely fail to recognize the significance of the discrepancy and its implications for subsequent patient care, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., speculating on rare conditions without sufficient evidence) in this context might generate unsubstantiated alarms and distract clinicians from the most probable explanations. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing information from the X-ray findings and operative notes, inferring potential reasons for the discrepancy (e.g., technical limitations of imaging, subtle lesions), and suggesting immediate actions such as further imaging or consultation with the surgical team.

This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, evaluating the clinical soundness of a hypothetical statement regarding antibiotic discontinuation in the face of concerning symptoms, requires the AI to actively detect potential errors in clinical reasoning and assess the risks associated with a proposed course of action. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.8) would likely accept the statement at face value, failing to recognize the critical importance of the patient's persistent symptoms and the ongoing diagnostic workup, leading to a missed opportunity to prevent premature antibiotic cessation.
