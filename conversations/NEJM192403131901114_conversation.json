He presented with a rapid decline—drowsiness, confusion, severe headache, irrationality—over three days. This acute phase was preceded by a week of flu-like symptoms and, importantly, a 1.5-year history of neck stiffness and occipital pain, plus a 6-month dry cough. His history includes pleurisy and an interesting note about 'physiological glycosuria' a year and a half prior, which today would prompt a thorough workup for diabetes or renal glycosuria, not just dismissal after dietary changes. Fifteen months before admission, a neck abscess was drained; it was suspected to be tuberculous, though smears and cultures were negative – a finding not entirely surprising for paucibacillary TB without today's molecular diagnostics like NAAT.",

This triad is classic. The negative Wassermann is good for ruling out neurosyphilis.

The spine X-rays were deemed 'normal' for the lower cervical/upper dorsal, with only a C1 'abnormality, perhaps due to position.' For his severe, chronic neck stiffness, this is insufficient.

This was undoubtedly the primary engine of dissemination. Obsolete TB in bronchial glands. The right lung also had a fibrocaseous apical lesion.
