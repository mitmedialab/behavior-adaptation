        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[primarily_reactive]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'primarily_reactive' with a proactive_score of 0.35 (within the 0.2-0.4 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, outlining the chronological development of a patient's symptoms based on the HPI summary, requires the AI to perform timeline sequencing and straightforward reasoning directly from the provided information. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.2) would likely simply regurgitate individual facts without synthesizing them into a coherent chronological narrative, failing to address the core question. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.4) in this context might lead the AI to speculate on underlying causes or alternative interpretations beyond what is explicitly stated in the HPI summary, potentially introducing inaccuracies. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent extracting relevant details about symptom onset and progression from the HPI summary and arranging them in a chronological order. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to efficiently summarize and organize patient information. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as \"timeline sequencing, straightforward reasoning from stated info\", are directly applicable here.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'identifying key clinical findings that support or refute an initial diagnostic hypothesis', requires the AI to retrieve relevant information from the provided context and synthesize it with clinical knowledge to evaluate the strength of evidence for and against a primary cardiac etiology. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely only identify explicitly stated facts without connecting them to the broader clinical picture or considering alternative explanations, potentially missing crucial nuances in the patient's presentation. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to over-interpretation of limited data, drawing unsubstantiated conclusions about the underlying cause without sufficient justification from the available evidence. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent retrieving relevant details from the patient's history, physical exam, and presenting complaints, then synthesizing these elements to assess their consistency with a primary cardiac etiology while also considering alternative explanations for the observed symptoms. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical reasoning and decision support by providing a balanced and informed assessment of the available information.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[primarily_proactive]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'primarily_proactive' with a proactive_score of 0.75 (within the 0.6-0.8 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'identifying factors contributing to a challenging clinical diagnosis based on limited information', requires the AI to actively interpret and synthesize information from multiple sources (clinical data, autopsy findings, expert commentary) to understand why the initial diagnosis was incorrect. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely only summarize the information presented without drawing meaningful connections between the clinical presentation and the autopsy results, failing to identify the key factors that led to the misdiagnosis. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.8) in this context might lead to speculation about alternative diagnoses or attributing blame without sufficient evidence, which is inappropriate and could be harmful. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing information from different sources, inferring the relative importance of different clinical findings, and evaluating how these factors influenced the diagnostic reasoning process, ultimately identifying the reasons for the diagnostic difficulty. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide insights into complex clinical cases. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'significant inference, interpretation, evaluating consistency/SOC based on summary', are directly applicable here, as the agent must infer the underlying reasons for the diagnostic challenge by interpreting the available data and evaluating its consistency with the expected clinical picture. The task is broadly categorized as 'highly_reactive' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data and understanding the reasoning behind a clinical decision. Answer Rationale: The initial presentation of dyspnea, edema, ascites, and orthopnea strongly suggested a systemic illness affecting the heart and kidneys, consistent with the eventual diagnosis of amyloidosis and miliary tuberculosis.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[primarily_proactive]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'primarily_proactive' with a proactive_score of 0.75 (within the 0.6-0.8 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'identifying factors contributing to a challenging clinical diagnosis based on limited information', requires the AI to actively interpret and synthesize information from multiple sources (clinical data, autopsy findings, expert commentary) to understand why the initial diagnosis was incorrect. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely only summarize the information presented without drawing meaningful connections between the clinical presentation and the autopsy results, failing to identify the key factors that led to the misdiagnosis. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.8) in this context might lead to speculation about alternative diagnoses or attributing blame without sufficient evidence, which is inappropriate and could be harmful. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing information from different sources, inferring the relative importance of different clinical findings, and evaluating how these factors influenced the diagnostic reasoning process, ultimately identifying the reasons for the diagnostic difficulty. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide insights into complex clinical cases. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'significant inference, interpretation, evaluating consistency/SOC based on summary', are directly applicable here, as the agent must infer the underlying reasons for the diagnostic challenge by interpreting the available data and evaluating its consistency with the expected clinical picture. The task is broadly categorized as 'highly_reactive' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data and understanding the reasoning behind a clinical decision.

This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'interpreting specific lab results within a complex clinical context to generate a differential diagnosis', requires the AI to retrieve relevant medical knowledge and synthesize it with the provided patient data to infer likely diagnoses. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely only reiterate the given information without connecting the specific lab findings (low specific gravity and lymphocyte predominance) to a broader range of possible underlying conditions, failing to generate a comprehensive differential. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to the generation of extremely rare or unlikely diagnoses without sufficient justification from the available data, potentially misleading the clinician. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent retrieving information about various conditions that can cause pleural effusions with low specific gravity and lymphocyte predominance, and then synthesizing this information with the existing rationale to generate a prioritized list of differential diagnoses.

The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data to formulate a differential diagnosis. Answer Rationale: Low specific gravity indicates a high likelihood of a transudative effusion, which can be seen in both infectious and neoplastic processes. Lymphocyte predominance in pleural fluid points towards a lymphocytic etiology.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'interpreting specific lab results within a complex clinical context to generate a differential diagnosis', requires the AI to retrieve relevant medical knowledge and synthesize it with the provided patient data to infer likely diagnoses. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely only reiterate the given information without connecting the specific lab findings (low specific gravity and lymphocyte predominance) to a broader range of possible underlying conditions, failing to generate a comprehensive differential. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to the generation of extremely rare or unlikely diagnoses without sufficient justification from the available data, potentially misleading the clinician. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent retrieving information about various conditions that can cause pleural effusions with low specific gravity and lymphocyte predominance, and then synthesizing this information with the existing rationale to generate a prioritized list of differential diagnoses. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data to formulate a differential diagnosis. Answer Rationale: Low specific gravity indicates a high likelihood of a transudative effusion, which can be seen in both infectious and neoplastic processes. Lymphocyte predominance in pleural fluid points towards a lymphocytic etiology.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.57 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'identifying subtle clues indicative of a specific diagnosis from a complex case summary', requires the AI to actively retrieve relevant information from different parts of the case and synthesize it to infer the underlying chronic infectious process. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely fail to connect the disparate pieces of information across the history, physical exam, and lab results, missing the subtle but critical clues suggesting TB. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to over-interpreting the available data and prematurely suggesting TB even before sufficient evidence has been gathered, potentially introducing bias. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent retrieving key findings, inferring their significance in the context of the patient's presentation, and synthesizing these findings to highlight the early indicators of a chronic infectious process. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy by identifying subtle patterns and suggesting plausible diagnoses. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here. The task is broadly categorized as 'primarily_reactive' due to its focus on interpreting diagnostic data.

This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, evaluating a hypothetical clinical decision for soundness in light of a patient's presentation and diagnostic findings, requires the AI to actively detect potential errors in reasoning and evaluate the consistency of the proposed action with established medical knowledge and the patient's specific context.
