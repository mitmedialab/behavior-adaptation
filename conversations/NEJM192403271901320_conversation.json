The diaphragm was at the third rib on the right. That is high. On the left it was at the fifth rib. There were only a few pleural adhesions. The lungs were negative except for a focus on each side of obsolete tuberculosis, one of which, on the left, was near the apex. The liver weighed 2895 grams,\u2014considerably enlarged, yet its anterior margin was only a little below the costal border.
