This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, evaluating a clinical conversation for potential omissions in the context of a patient's deteriorating condition, requires the AI to actively infer a critical, unstated event (cardiac arrest) and its preceding signs and symptoms. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely fail to recognize the gap in the conversation, missing the crucial information about the patient's changing status and the need for immediate intervention. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.9) in this context might lead to unfounded speculation about other potential undocumented events, distracting from the primary issue of the missing cardiac arrest report. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent identifying the logical discontinuity between the administration of Strophanthin and the subsequent order for chest compressions, inferring the likely content of the missing turn (the report of cardiac arrest), and highlighting this omission as a critical element in the patient's care. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical vigilance and decision support by identifying potential gaps in documentation or reasoning.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[reasoning]. Behavior: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'reasoning' with a proactive_score of 0.35 (within the 0.2-0.4 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'assessing how a clinical assessment changes over time based on new information', requires the AI to actively synthesize information from two distinct timepoints and infer the implications of those changes for the differential diagnosis. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.2) would likely fail to recognize the significance of the evolving clinical picture, potentially overlooking the critical shift towards a cardiac etiology indicated by the rapid deterioration and failing to appreciate the impact of specific lab findings like elevated WBC and the absence of significant renal involvement. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.4) in this context might prematurely commit to a specific cardiac diagnosis without sufficient evidence or overemphasize less likely diagnoses, leading to a biased assessment. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent critically comparing and contrasting the information available at Timepoint A and Timepoint B, highlighting the key differences, inferring the most likely underlying causes for those differences, and suggesting a revised differential diagnosis that reflects the evolving clinical picture. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes by providing informed and evidence-based recommendations. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'significant inference, interpretation, evaluating consistency/SOC based on summary', are directly applicable here, as the task demands significant inferential reasoning to connect the dots between the two time points and arrive at a revised assessment. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on refining a differential diagnosis based on new clinical information. Answer Rationale: At Timepoint A, the patient presented with dyspnea, edema, and a history suggestive of fluid overload, leading to a broad differential including cardiac, renal, and potentially infectious etiologies. The initial labs showed elevated WBC, but without further details, it was unclear whether this was a reactive response to fluid overload or indicative of a specific underlying infection.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[reasoning]. Behavior: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'reasoning' with a proactive_score of 0.35 (within the 0.2-0.4 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'assessing how a clinical assessment changes over time based on new information', requires the AI to actively synthesize information from two distinct timepoints and infer the implications of those changes for the differential diagnosis. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.2) would likely fail to recognize the significance of the evolving clinical picture, potentially overlooking the critical shift towards a cardiac etiology indicated by the rapid deterioration and failing to appreciate the impact of specific lab findings like elevated WBC and the absence of significant renal involvement. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.4) in this context might prematurely commit to a specific cardiac diagnosis without sufficient evidence or overemphasize less likely diagnoses, leading to a biased assessment. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent critically comparing and contrasting the information available at Timepoint A and Timepoint B, highlighting the key differences, inferring the most likely underlying causes for those differences, and suggesting a revised differential diagnosis that reflects the evolving clinical picture. This aligns with the role of a medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes by providing informed and evidence-based recommendations. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'significant inference, interpretation, evaluating consistency/SOC based on summary', are directly applicable here, as the task demands significant inferential reasoning to connect the dots between the two time points and arrive at a revised assessment. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on refining a differential diagnosis based on new clinical information. Answer Rationale: At Timepoint A, the patient presented with dyspnea, edema, and a history suggestive of fluid overload, leading to a broad differential including cardiac, renal, and potentially infectious etiologies. The initial labs showed elevated WBC, but without further details, it was unclear whether this was a reactive response to fluid overload or indicative of a specific underlying infection. However, at Timepoint B, the patient rapidly deteriorates with severe tachycardia, tachypnea, pulmonary edema, and ultimately, sudden collapse. These findings, especially the tachycardia and tachypnea, are highly suggestive of acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to a]",
