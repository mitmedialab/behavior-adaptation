Considering the 1924 team's eventual post-mortem finding of no vertebral TB (Turn 8, Dr. Tanaka), how does Dr. Sharma's modern perspective on imaging necessity refine the understanding of the diagnostic challenges faced in 1924 regarding the patient's neck symptoms, even if vertebral TB was ultimately ruled out?",

While the X-rays were negative for gross osseous TB, they couldn't provide the detailed soft tissue and early bone marrow assessment an MRI offers. This underscores that the 1924 team's inability to pinpoint a non-meningitic cause for the severe neck pain was partly due to diagnostic limitations, forcing reliance on broader clinical suspicion and less sensitive imaging, even if the ultimate autopsy for vertebral TB was negative.",

Even though vertebral TB was ruled out post-mortem, the 1924 team struggled to explain the severe chronic neck pain.

His advanced state at presentation would still carry a poor prognosis, but there'd be a fighting chance.'
