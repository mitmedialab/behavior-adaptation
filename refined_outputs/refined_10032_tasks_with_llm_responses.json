        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'synthesizing a constellation of clinical findings to support a specific diagnosis', requires the AI to actively retrieve relevant information from the provided context and synthesize it to identify the key indicators of increased intracranial pressure and meningitis. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely simply list the symptoms without connecting them to the underlying pathology, failing to highlight the significance of the constellation. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might over-interpret the data and prematurely conclude the diagnosis without considering alternative explanations. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent identifying and synthesizing the key symptoms and signs (progressive vomiting, drowsiness, extremity spasms, right internal strabismus,unequal pupils, Brudzinski sign) to support the clinical suspicion of increased intracranial pressure and meningitis. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance diagnostic reasoning by highlighting critical clinical findings. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as 'requires retrieval AND inference/synthesis across sections', are directly applicable here. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_ddx_reasoning' due to its focus on interpreting clinical data to support a differential diagnosis. Answer Rationale: The combination of progressive vomiting, drowsiness, and the presence of a positive Brudzinski sign are highly suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. The right internal strabismus and unequal pupils further support the diagnosis of meningitis. <answer>D</answer> Progressive, forceful vomiting, increasing drowsiness, extremity spasms, right internal strabismus, unequal pupils with sluggish reflex, and a positive Brudzinski sign collectively indicate neurological involvement and increased intracranial pressure, leading the physicians to suspect meningitis.<|im_end|>",
        "Type B (General SFT)": "Rationale: These findings are classic signs of meningeal irritation and inflammation, which is the hallmark of meningitis. The vomiting, altered mental status, and focal neurological signs (strabismus, extremity spasms) are highly suggestive of increased intracranial pressure and the need for urgent investigation via lumbar puncture. <answer>D</answer> Progressive, forceful vomiting, increasing drowsiness, extremity spasms, right internal strabismus, unequal pupils with sluggish reflex, and a positive Brudzinski sign collectively indicate neurological involvement and increased intracranial pressure, leading the physicians to suspect meningitis.",
        "Type C (Baseline)": "The best option is D: Progressive, forceful vomiting, increasing drowsiness, extremity spasms, right internal strabismus, unequal pupils with sluggish reflex, and a positive Brudzinski sign collectively indicate neurological involvement and increased intracranial pressure, leading the physicians to suspect meningitis.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Progressive, forceful vomiting:** This symptom is consistent with increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to vomiting as the brainstem is compressed.\n- **Increasing drowsiness:** This suggests a progressive neurological decline, often seen in conditions like meningitis.\n- **Extremity spasms:** These spasms, especially those requiring chloroform, are indicative of severe neurological distress.\n- **Right internal strabismus:** This finding points to potential cranial nerve involvement, which can occur with meningitis.\n- **Unequal pupils with sluggish reflex:** This indicates possible midbrain dysfunction, another sign of increased intracranial pressure.\n- **Positive Brudzinski sign:** This neurological sign is a strong indicator of meningeal irritation, further supporting the diagnosis of meningitis.\n\nThese findings collectively support the clinical suspicion of increased intracranial pressure and meningitis, prompting the decision for a lumbar puncture. Options A, B, C, and E either do not align with the patient's presentation or do not provide enough evidence to support the specific neurological signs and symptoms described."

This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'comparing and contrasting the likelihood of different diagnoses based on limited information', requires the AI to retrieve relevant information from the case summary and synthesize it to evaluate the strength of evidence supporting each diagnosis.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'synthesizing disparate lab results to confirm a physician's suspicion', requires the AI to actively retrieve and synthesize information from multiple sources (blood work and CSF analysis) and infer their combined significance in the context of a suspected infection. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely only report the individual values without connecting them to the broader clinical picture or understanding their implications for infection, missing the crucial link between the elevated WBC count and the CSF abnormalities. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might prematurely conclude a specific infectious etiology without considering other possibilities or requiring further diagnostic confirmation. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent extracting relevant data points from each lab result, identifying patterns (e.g., high polynuclears, elevated WBC, elevated CSF pressure), and then synthesizing these findings to strongly support the physician's suspicion of a severe infection, specifically affecting the central nervous system. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical reasoning and provide comprehensive decision support.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[balanced]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'balanced' with a proactive_score of 0.55 (within the 0.4-0.6 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'synthesizing disparate lab results to confirm a physician's suspicion', requires the AI to actively retrieve and synthesize information from multiple sources (blood work and CSF analysis) and infer their combined significance in the context of a suspected infection. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely only report the individual values without connecting them to the broader clinical picture or understanding their implications for infection, missing the crucial link between the elevated WBC count and the CSF abnormalities. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might prematurely conclude a specific infectious etiology without considering other possibilities or requiring further diagnostic confirmation. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent extracting relevant data points from each lab result, identifying patterns (e.g., high polynuclears, elevated WBC, elevated CSF pressure), and then synthesizing these findings to strongly support the physician's suspicion of a severe infection, specifically affecting the central nervous system. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical reasoning and provide comprehensive decision support.

This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'synthesizing evidence from various sources to determine the most likely primary source and route of a fatal infection', requires the AI to actively retrieve information from different parts of the provided text and synthesize it to arrive at a conclusion. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.4) would likely fail to connect the disparate pieces of information â€“ social history, post-mortem findings, and physician's discussion â€“ leading to a fragmented and incomplete understanding of the case. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.6) in this context might lead to over-interpretation of the available data, potentially introducing unsupported assumptions about the infection's progression or the physicians' reasoning. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent extracting key details from each source, identifying the temporal relationship between the lung and mesenteric lesions, and inferring the most probable primary source (bovine milk) based on the social history and the discussion about milk consumption.

Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'primarily_proactive' with a proactive_score of 0.69 (within the 0.6-0.8 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, 'evaluating the logical flow of a clinical conversation for potential omissions in information exchange', requires the AI to actively infer the content of missing turns and evaluate the consistency of the conversation based on the surrounding context. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.6) would likely fail to recognize the abrupt shift in the conversation and miss the implied gap in information exchange, leading to a superficial understanding of the patient's condition. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.8) in this context might lead to unwarranted assumptions about the missing turns, potentially introducing biases or inaccuracies into the assessment. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing information from non-adjacent turns, identifying the logical discontinuity, and inferring the likely content of the missing turns based on the surrounding dialogue and clinical context. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to enhance clinical vigilance and decision support by identifying potential gaps in communication.

        "Type A (Behavior SFT)": "[reactive]. Behavior Rationale: For this task, the target proactive behavior is 'reactive' with a proactive_score of 0.1 (within the 0.0-0.2 range). This level of proactivity is mandated because the task, identifying the most appropriate immediate next step in a post-mortem case with a confirmed diagnosis, primarily requires the AI to perform straightforward reasoning from explicitly stated information. A more reactive agent (e.g., score < 0.0) would likely fail to connect the post-mortem findings to the need for further investigation into the source of the TB, essentially missing the opportunity to highlight a potentially important diagnostic step. Conversely, an excessively proactive stance (e.g., score > 0.2) in this context might lead to premature speculation about specific etiologies without sufficient evidence, which could be misleading or unhelpful. The optimal behavior involves the LLM Agent synthesizing the provided information (post-mortem findings) and applying basic medical knowledge to suggest the most logical next step (determining the source of infection), while acknowledging the limitations of the information provided. This aligns with the role of a Medical AI assistant designed to provide focused and relevant support for medical decision-making. The characteristics for this proactive category, such as \"timeline sequencing, straightforward reasoning from stated info\", are directly applicable here. The task is broadly categorized as 'reactive_timeline_sequence' due to its focus on sequencing events and determining the most appropriate next step in a clinical timeline. Answer Rationale: While the patient has already passed away, determining the source of the tuberculosis infection is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and potentially informing future management strategies. This information is not explicitly provided in the case summary, but it is a standard part of the workup after a post-mortem diagnosis. <answer>C</answer> Initiate investigation to identify the source of the tuberculosis infection.<|im_end|>",
        "Type B (General SFT)": "Rationale: While the post-mortem confirms the diagnosis, the patient is deceased and treatment is not possible. The next best step is to focus on understanding the disease process to improve future patient care and potentially prevent similar outcomes in other patients. <answer>C</answer> Initiate investigation to identify the source of the tuberculosis infection.",
        "Type C (Baseline)": "The most appropriate immediate next step for the medical team in this case is:\n\n**E: Initiate immediate antituberculosis treatment**\n\n### Rationale:\nGiven that the patient has been diagnosed with widespread miliary tuberculosis based on post-mortem findings, it is critical to initiate antituberculosis treatment as soon as possible. Post-mortem findings confirm the severity and extent of the infection, which necessitates prompt intervention to prevent further complications and to address the systemic nature of the disease. Immediate treatment can help reduce the burden of disease and improve outcomes for any potential living patients or contacts who might be at risk. Drug susceptibility testing (Option A) is important but can be conducted after initiating treatment, and further imaging (Option B) would be more relevant if the patient were still alive to assess active disease. Identifying the source of infection (Option C) is also important but not an immediate priority compared to starting treatment. Scheduling a follow-up appointment (Option D) is not feasible since the patient has passed away. Therefore, initiating antituberculosis treatment is the most urgent and appropriate action."
