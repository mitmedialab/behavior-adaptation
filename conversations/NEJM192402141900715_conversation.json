So far it sounds like an ordinary pneumonia. The onset of stupor, however, is a surprising feature of the case if it is pneumonia, and it is for this reason that the inquiries about the two capsules are instituted. Since they were given to deaden pain there is every reason to suppose that they contained morphin. It is not likely, however, that they contained enough so that two of them, spaced as these have been, could have accounted for the patient's coma. Possibly the cough medicine also contained morphin. This has been given more frequently, but the ordinary traditions of the medical profession seem to me to make it unlikely that there was morphin both in the capsules and in the cough medicine. There may have been codeia in the latter, but this also I should think was rather improbable. On the whole then I incline to think that the stupor must have been due to the same cause as the other apparently infectious symptoms, and has no particular relation to anything that she has taken as medicine.'"

Pneumonia then, our first supposition, seems to be supported by more and more evidence as we go on through the account of the case. The irregularities of the heart are such as are often seen in pneumonia and do not po.nt to any separate disease of that organ.

I believe then that the necropsy will show extensive pneumonia of the right lung and very possibly some of the same disease in the left, though we have no positive evidence of that during life. The other organs should show the usual evidences of an acute infection, and the pleura should show an acute inflammation, very possibly with the accumulation of a fluid, serous or purulent, which did not make itself obvious in the physical examination. Purulent pleurisy is a particularly common complication in a case like this. I do not believe that the stupor was connected with any cause other than the pneumonia.

The gastro-intestinal tract was negative except there were a few small smooth walled intact diverticula in the sigmoid colon. The pleural cavities were empty. There were a few old pleural adhesions on each side. The trachea and bronchi contained much mucopurulent material and the mucosa showed dirty reddish discoloration. The bronchial glands were moderately enlarged, pigmented and generally soft and juicy. One of the glands, however, at the bifurcation of the trachea showed fibrocalcareous degeneration, obsolete tuberculosis. The upper lobe of the right lung was voluminous, solid, and coated with fibrinous ex\u00fadate. The section surfaces were gray-red to gray, homogeneous, granular, and yielded much mucopurulent fluid material. The pneumonia involved the apex, which otherwise was negative. The middle lobe was rather voluminous, solid and showed gray-red to gray pneumonia. The lower lobe in the region of its upper part posteriorly over about one-third of its volume showed gray-red to gray pneumonia, and anteriorly a short distance below this there was a focus of gray-red pneumonia about four and one-half cm. in diameter. The tissue of the lobe elsewhere was purplish red, spongy, and yielded a small amount of thin reddish frothy fluid. The apex of the left lung was negative. From a point about 4 cm. below the apex and down to the diaphragm the upper lobe was solid and showed gray-red to gray pneumonia. In the region of the middle portion of the lower lobe posteriorly to the left there was an area of grayred pneumonia about 5-7 cm. The tissue of this lobe elsewhere was purplish red, spongy, and yielded a moderate amount of reddish frothy fluid. The heart weighed 500 grams, considerably enlarged. The myocardium was of good consistence, pale brown-red, and showed no evidence of myocarditis. The cavities were of full size on the left and showed slight dilatation on the right. The mitral and aortic valves showed a moderate amrv nt of the usual fibrosis, but the valves were otherwise negative. The coronarles were free, but showed scattered along the intima some fibrous sclerosis, without, however, any marked diminution of their lumina. The aorta and the great branches generally showed much fibrous sclerosis. The liver weighed 1660 grams. The organ presented a few old adhesions to the diaphragm. The cut ends of the branches of the hepatic artery in the section surfaces showed fibrous sclerosis. The spleen weighed 105 grams, rather small. The tissue was rather mushy. The organ presented a few old adhesions to the diaphragm. The combined weight of the kidneys was 330 grams. The organs showed arteriosclerosis with some atrophy in places; no definite nephritis. The uterus was rather small and presented a small polyp springing from the mucosa of the upper part of the uterine cavity. The tubes were negative except for a slight hydrosalpinx on the left. The ovaries showed fibroid atrophy. Culture from the heart blood yielded a good growth of the pneumococcus. A typical case of lobar pneumonia in an arteriosclerotic.'"
